  I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as mama&#39;s hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I&#39;m doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I&#39;m pre-currency, post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I&#39;m Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye&#39;s best prodigy
He ain&#39;t signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don&#39;t even warn, I don&#39;t eat it warm, I won&#39;t be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people&#39;s champ must be everything the people can&#39;t be
I&#39;m getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You mustâ€™ve missed the come up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes
